    "## Handwritten Digit Recognition using Machine Learning and Deep Learning using MNIST Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of data science, the challenge of handwritten digit recognition has long persisted, requiring robust machine learning and deep learning models to accurately classify digits from 0 to 9. Leveraging the MNIST dataset, comprising 70,000 images of handwritten digits, with 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing, we embark on the journey of developing a solution to this task. These grayscale images, each measuring 28x28 pixels, provide a rich yet manageable dataset for our endeavors. Our primary aim is to employ Python, along with libraries like Scikit-Learn and Keras, to construct models capable of accurately discerning handwritten digits, thus presenting a foundational challenge in the realm of computer vision and pattern recognition."
